#
# Sample fwlogwatch configuration file
#
# Uncommented options are ON, commented are OFF.
# Look at 'fwlogwatch -h' for the current defaults. 


### Global options ###
# Use 'verbose' if you want extra information and log messages.
# Use it twice for even more info. Comment it out completely if
# you want fwlogwatch to be quiet.
#
#verbose
#verbose

# Use 'resolve' if you want IP addresses looked up in the DNS (slow).
#
#resolve

# Specify the input file if you don't want to use the default.
#
#input	= 


### Evaluation options ###
# The following six options define which criteria will be considered
# when comparing connection attempts.
#
#src_ip_off
#dst_ip_off
#protocol
#src_port
#dst_port
#tcp_opts

### Sorting options ###
# Since the sort algorithm used is stable you can sort several times,
# entries that are equal for the primary criteria will be sorted by the
# next criteria. The sort string can be composed 8 fields of the form 'ab'
# where 'a' is the sort criteria:
#
# c count
# S source host
# D destination host
# s source port
# t start time
# z duration
#
# and 'b' the direction:
#
# a ascending
# d descending
#
# Sorting is done in the order specified, so the last option is the primary
# criteria. If you don't use the 'sort_order' option the default 'tacd'
# will be used (start with the highest count, if two counts match list the
# one earlier in time first). If you specify an empty sort string or
# everything else is equal entries will be unsorted (as they come in the
# log file with the most recent unique entry found first).
#
#sort_order	= 

### Log summary mode ###
# Use 'times' if you want to see the timestamp of the first and last logged
# packet of each entry.
#
#times

# Use 'duration' if you want to see the time interval between the first and
# the last connection attempt of the current entry.
#
#duration

# Use 'html' to turn on html output.
#
#html

# With the following four options you can customize the colors of the
# summary, use the HTML RGB values.
#
#textcolor	= 000000
#bgcolor	= FFFFFF
#rowcolor1	= AAAAAA
#rowcolor2	= CCCCCC

# Specify the output file
#
#output	= summary.html

# Use 'recent' to ignore events older than a certain time (off by default).
# The default unit is seconds.
# Flags: m = minutes, h = hours, d = days, w = weeks, M = months, y = years.
#
#recent	= 3d

# Use 'at_least' to hide entries that have a small number of counts (useful
# when analyzing large log files).
#
#at_least	= 5

### Interactive report mode ###
# Use 'interactive' to turn this mode on, a summary will be presented first.
# If you use this comment out realtime response mode below since it will
# override this one if active.
#
#interactive

# Use 'sender' to specify your email address for abuse reports.
#
#sender	= 

# Use 'recipient' to specify the email address of the CERT you want to
# send reports to and don't want to use the default.
#
#recipient	= 

# You can use 'cc' to send a carbon copy of the report (e.g. to you for
# your archives or another abuse or CERT contact).
#
#cc	= root@localhost

# Use 'template' to specify the template file you want to use to surround
# the report if you don't want to use the default.
# The line '# insert template here' in the template will be
# replaced with the report.
#
#template	= fwlogwatch.template


### Realtime response mode ###
# Use 'realtime_response' to turn this mode on, it will override the other
# two.
#
#realtime_response

# Use 'alert_threshold' to define how many connections must happen (within
# the 'forget' time range) to activate an alert/response and don't want to
# use the default.
#
#alert_threshold	= 10

# Use the log summary option 'recent' above to control how long an event
# should be relevant, after the specified time it is forgotten and if
# another connection attempt is started it is treated as new.

# An alert is logged to syslog by default, you can add one of the following
# responses:
# - block the host completely with a new firewall rule ('block')
# - send an alert message to an email recipient ('email_notify')
# - display a winpopoup alert message on a windows machine ('smb_notify')
# - execute a custom action in a shell ('action')
#
#block
#email_notify	= 
#smb_notify	= hostname
#action	= 

# Known hosts are those that will not be warned about or actions taken
# against, even if they match the alert/response criteria.
# Use 'known_host' for your trusted gateways, peers and DNS servers (this
# is an anti-spoof measure).
#
#known_host	= 
#known_host	= 

# You can watch which hosts fwlogwatch knows and which ones it is watching
# at any time through it's web interface. Use the 'server_status' option to
# activate the web server in fwlogwatch, 'listen_to' restricts the hosts
# that can connect (defaults to 127.0.0.1 (localhost), 0.0.0.0 is anyone)
# and 'listen_port' is the port it will listen on (defaults to 888).
# fwlogwatch will want to authenticate the user, that's what 'status_user'
# and 'status_password' are for. The password must be a standard Unix DES
# encrypted password including salt, you can for example use
# htpasswd -nb user password
# to generate one.
#
#server_status
#listen_to	= 
#listen_port	= 
#status_user	= 
#status_password	= 


### Show log times mode ###
# Use this mode (together with 'input' if you don't want to use the
# default input file) to display the time of the first and last entry
# in the log file.
#
#show_log_times
