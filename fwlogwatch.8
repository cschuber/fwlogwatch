.TH FWLOGWATCH 8 "9 March 2001" RUS-CERT
.SH NAME
fwlogwatch \- a firewall log analyzer, report generator and realtime response agent
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fwlogwatch
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fwlogwatch
produces ipchains, netfilter/iptables, ipfilter and cisco log summary
reports in text and HTML form and has a lot of options to find and display
relevant patterns in packet logs. With the data found it can produce
customizable incident reports from a template and send them to abuse
contacts at offending sites or CERT coordination centers. Finally, it can
also run as daemon and report anomalies or start countermeasures.

.SH OPTIONS
The global options for all modes (at least where they make sense) are:
.IP \-c\ \fIconfig\fR
Use the alternate configuration file
.IR config .
If you use the default configuration file
.B /etc/fwlogwatch.config
command line parameters override
the options specified in the file. If you specify an alternate configuration
file only options not specified in the file can be overridden by command line
options.
.IP \-D
Do not differentiate destination IP addresses. Useful for finding scans in
whole subnets.
.IP \-d
Differentiate destination ports.
.IP \-f\ \fIfile\fR
Specify an input file (defaults to
.B /var/log/messages
). Relevant entries are automatically detected so combined log files (e.g.
from a log host) are no problem. Compressed files are supported (except in
realtime response mode).
.IP \-h
Show the available options.
.IP \-L\ \fIfile\fR
Show time of the first and the last log entry in the input
.I file
which can be a compressed or plain log file. Summary mode will show the
time of the first and last packet log entry, this log times mode
will show the time of the first and last entry overall.
.IP \-l\ \fItime\fR
Process recent events only. See
.B TIME FORMAT
below for the time options.
.IP \-n
Enable DNS lookups. Host names will be resolved (reverse and forward lookup
with a warning if they don't match). This makes summary generation very
slow if a lot of different hosts appear in the log file.
.IP \-P\ \fIformat\fR
Only use certain parsers, where the log
.I format
can be one or a combination of:
.I i
ipchains,
.I n
netfilter,
.I c
cisco and
.I f
ipfilter.
.IP \-p
Differentiate protocols. This is activated automatically if you
differentiate source and/or destination ports.
.IP \-S
Do not differentiate source IP addresses.
.IP \-s
Differentiate source ports.
.IP \-t
Show start and end times of logged packets. End times are only available if
there is more than one packet log entry with unique characteristics.
.IP \-V
Show version and copyright information.
.IP \-v
Be verbose. You can specify it twice for more information.
In very verbose mode while parsing the log file you will see "." for
relevant packet filter log entries, "o" for packet filter log entries that
are too old and "_" for entries that are not packet filter logs.
.IP \-y
Differentiate TCP options. All packets with a SYN are listed separately,
other TCP flags are shown in full format if they are available (ipchains
does not log them, netfilter and ipfilter do, cisco doesn't even log SYNs).
.IP \-z
Show time interval between start and end time of packet log entries. This
is only available if there is more than one packet log entry with unique
characteristics.
.SH "LOG SUMMARY MODE"
This are additional options that are only available in log summary mode:
.IP \-b
Show the amount of data in bytes this entry represents, this is the sum of
total packet lengths of packets matching this rule.
.IP \-m\ \fIcount\fR
When analyzing large log files you usually aren't interested in entries that
have a small count. You can hide entries below a certain threshold with
this option.
.IP \-o\ \fIfile\fR
Specify an output file.
.IP \-O\ \fIorder\fR
This is the sort order of the summary. Since entries often are
equal in certain fields you can sort by several fields one after another
(the sort algorithm is stable, so equal entries will remain sorted in the
order they were sorted before). The sort string can be composed of up to 8
fields of the form
.B ab
where
.B a
is the sort criteria:
.I c
count,
.I t
start time,
.I z
duration,
.I n
target name,
.I p
protocol,
.I b
sum of total packet lengths,
.I S
source host,
.I s
source port,
.I D
destination host and
.I d
destination port.
.B b
is the direction:
.I a
ascending and
.I d
descending.
Sorting is done in the order specified, so the last option is the primary
criteria. The default is
.I tacd
(start with the highest count, if two counts match list the one earlier in
time first) of which
.I ta
is built in., so if you specify an empty sort string or everything else is
equal entries will be sorted ascending by time.
.IP \-w
Produce output in HTML format.
.SH "INTERACTIVE REPORT MODE"
.IP \-i\ \fIcount\fR
Enter interactive report mode.
.I count
is the minimum number of log entries you want to start reporting at. A
summary of the corresponding entries will be shown and a report generated
for each one. The more of the options above you use the more fields of the
report will be filled in.
.IP \-F\ \fIemail\fR
This is the address the email containing the report will be sent from.
.IP \-T\ \fIemail\fR
This is the email address of the abuse contact or CERT the report will be
sent to.
.IP \-C\ \fIemail\fR
These email recipients will get a carbon copy of the report (e.g. for your
archives).
.IP \-I\ \fIfile\fR
Template file for report (defaults to
.B /etc/fwlogwatch.template
).
.SH "REALTIME RESPONSE MODE"
.IP \-R
Enter realtime response mode. This means: detach, check if the firewall is
configured correctly and run as daemon until the SIGTERM signal (kill) is
received. All output can be followed in the system log.
.IP \-a\ \fIcount\fR
Alert threshold. Notify or start countermeasures if this limit is reached.
Defaults to 5.
.IP \-l\ \fItime\fR
Forget events that happened this long ago (defaults to 1 day). See
.B TIME FORMAT
below for the time options.
.IP \-k\ \fIIP/net\fR
This option defines a host or network in CIDR notation that will never be
blocked or other actions taken against. To specify more than one, use the
-k parameter again for each IP address or network you want to add.
.IP \-M\ \fIemail\fR
Send an email notification to the specified
.I email
address.
.IP \-B
Block host completely with new firewall rule. A new chain for
.B fwlogwatch
actions is inserted in the input chain and block rules added as needed.
The chain and its content is removed if
.B fwlogwatch
is terminated normally.
.IP \-W\ \fIhost\fR
Send a winpopup alert message to the windows machine
.IR host .
.IP \-A\ \fIaction\fR
This custom
.I action
is executed in a shell.
.IP \-X
Activate the internal web server to monitor the current status of the program.
Use the configuration file to change it's options. The default user name is
.B admin
and the default password is
.B fwlogwat
since DES can only encrypt 8 characters. By default it listens on port
888 and only allows connections from localhost.
.SH "TIME FORMAT"
Time is specified as
.B nx
where
.B n
is a natural number and
.B x
is one of the
following:
.I s
for seconds (default if you don't specify anything),
.I m
for minutes,
.I h
for hours,
.I d
for days,
.I w
for weeks,
.I M
for months and
.I y
for years.
.SH FILES
.IP \fB/etc/fwlogwatch.config\fR
Default configuration file.
.IP \fB/etc/fwlogwatch.template\fR
Default template for incident reports.
.IP \fB/var/log/messages\fR
Default input log file.
.IP \fB/var/run/fwlogwatch.pid\fR
PID file generated by the daemon in realtime response mode.
.SH "FEATURES ONLY IN CONFIGURATION FILE"
The following features are only available in the configuration file and not
on the command line, they are presented and explained in the sample
configuration file.
.IP HTML\ colors
The colors of the HTML output page can be customized.
.IP status\ server\ options
The host that can access the web interface, the port it listens to and the
user and password can be changed.
.IP host\ and\ port\ selection\ and\ exclusion
Hosts and ports to be summarized can be selected or excluded.
.SH "NETFILTER, IPFILTER AND CISCO SUPPORT"
fwlogwatch also features iptables/netfilter, ipfilter and cisco log file
support, it can even combine or separate the formats if you activate or
deactivate the corresponding parsers. Some restrictions apply because not all
fields exist or make sense in all log file types. The block response in
realtime response mode only works for ipchains and you will need to
deactivate the ipchains parser if you want to use realtime response mode on
a system without ipchains.
.SH SECURITY
Since
.B fwlogwatch
is a security tool and needs superuser permissions for certain tasks
special care was taken to make it secure. You can run it with user
permissions for most functions or you can make it setgid for a
group
.B /var/log/messages
is in if all you need is to be able to read this file. Only the realtime
response mode with activated ipchains parser needs superuser permissions
to analyze (and in block mode also modify) the firewall rules.
