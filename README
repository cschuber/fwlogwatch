fwlogwatch is a security tool written in C by Boris Wesslowski for the
RUS-CERT. It is a packet filter/firewall log analyzer with support for
linux ipchains, netfilter/iptables and cisco log files. It also features
incident report and realtime response capabilities.

It is available from the RUS-CERT website
http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/projects/fwlogwatch/
and from
http://www.kyb.uni-stuttgart.de/boris/software.shtml


FEATURES
- Log summary mode:
  - A lot of options to find and display relevant patterns in connection
    attempts.
  - Intelligent selection of certain fields (e.g. the host name column is
    omitted and the host mentioned in the header of the summary if the
    log is from a single host, the same happens with the chains, targets
    and interfaces).
  - Can separate recent from old entries and detects timewarps in log files.
  - Plain text and HTML output with sort options.
  - Integrated resolver for protocols, services and host names.
  - Own DNS cache for faster lookups.
  - Detects and processes ipchains, netfilter/iptables and cisco log
    entries, in separate files or even combined.

- Interactive report mode:
  - The integrated report generator fills and presents a
    report that can be sent to abuse contacts of attacking sites or
    computer emergency response and coordination centers (CERT/CC).
  - Supports templates and incident number generation.
  - All fields can be adjusted as needed interactively.

- Realtime response mode:
  - The program detaches and stays in the background as a daemon.
  - It detects if the necessary ipchains rules with logging turned on exist.
  - Response can be a notification (in form of a log file entry, an email or
    a remote winpopup message), a firewall modification or anything you can
    invoke in a shell.
  - In block mode a new chain for fwlogwatch is added and attackers are
    completely blocked with new firewall rules. Supports trusted hosts
    (anti-spoof).
  - The current status of the program can be followed through a web
    interface.

The commented configuration file supports and explains all options and will
get you started quickly.


NETFILTER AND CISCO SUPPORT
fwlogwatch features iptables/netfilter and cisco log file support, it can
even parse combined log files. Some restrictions apply because not all
fields exist or make sense in all log file types. Realtime response mode
only works for ipchains. It is assumed that if you use netfilter or cisco
you know how to get it to produce usable log entries.


BASICS (for ipchains)
- Create an ipchains packet filter with allow rules for all connections you
  need, as tight as possible.

- Your default policy should be DENY:

    ipchains -P input DENY
    ipchains -P forward DENY

  although they won't be needed since all prohibited traffic
  will be intercepted by the following logging rules:

    ipchains -A input -l -j DENY
    ipchains -A forward -l -j DENY

  so the last line in your input, forward and custom chains should be

    target     prot opt     source                destination           ports
    DENY       all  ----l-  anywhere              anywhere              n/a

- You can also specify rules for the output chain but you should use the
  target REJECT (you/your users will notice faster what the problem is when
  trying something the policy forbids).

- If you have a persistent log spammer drop his packets by inserting a DENY
  rule before the logging rule above (or use the block response mode).


INSTALLATION
For ipchains you will need at least kernel 2.2.10 (which you should have
updated for security reasons anyway), kernel versions before 2.2.10 don't
log enough.

Before compiling you may want to have a look at main.h if you want to
change some default values. To compile on Solaris look for the corresponding
lines at the top of the Makefile.

A simple 'make' should be enough to obtain a working binary. If you use the
realtime response mode you will need to install fwlogwatch with superuser
permissions. If all you need is read access to the systems standard log
file (e.g. /var/log/messages) you can use group permissions.
'make install' will install the binary (in /usr/local/sbin) and the man
page, 'make install-config' will also install a sample configuration file
and template in /etc.

You can define the TMPDIR environment variable if you don't want fwlogwatch
to create it's temporary files in /tmp.


CONFIGURATION AND EXAMPLES
- You should make a configuration file for each function you want, look at
  the included sample file, it should be easy to adapt it to your needs.

- If you want a HTML summary 'log.html' of all packet filter entries at
  most one day old from the file 'messages' with timestamps, time intervals,
  resolved IP addresses and service names and with connections separated by
  protocol, source and destination ports and TCP options you would use

    fwlogwatch -v -v -s -d -t -z -y -n -p -w -l 1d -o log.html -f messages

- If you want to use fwlogwatch as a CGI, e.g. to have a quick look at
  what happened in the last hour when you get a notification:
  Copy the file fwlogwatch.small.cgi to a place where your web server
  can execute it (fwlogwatch must be reachable and have enough
  permissions to read the log file).

- A script for generation of 8 general summaries is also included, use
  it as 'fwlogsummary.cgi [logfile]' (it will use the output directory
  /home/httpd/html/fwlogwatch as default) and look at the index.html file
  to select the level of detail you need.

- You might want to replace your /etc/services file by the one supplied
  with nmap, a lot more services will be recognized, you can also add the
  ICMP types (don't assign one to 0 since it is the ipchains default).
